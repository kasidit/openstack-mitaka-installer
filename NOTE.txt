The scripts are developed using simple text substitution techniques. 

Openstack configuration parameters are defined 
to have initial value string at first. These value string would then be subsituted
by user-defined environment variables' values when running the ./exe-config.sh command. 

This openstack-mitaka0-compact-installer branch only uses 3 nodes: controller, network, and compute.
It was designed for a notebook with a minimal 8GB Ram.
